- **Player Count**: Displays total players online.
- **Job Roles**: Shows player jobs such as police, EMS, and more.
- **Ping Display**: Displays player ping to the server.
- **Customizable Design**: Easily customizable to fit the server‚Äôs theme and style.
- **Performance Efficient**: Lightweight and optimized for large player bases.
- **Toggle Scoreboard**: Use a configurable key to open and close the scoreboard.

## **Installation**

### **Step 1: Download & Extract**
1. Download the script and extract it to your server‚Äôs `resources` folder.
2. Place the extracted folder under `[lxr]`.

```

## **Configuration**

### **Key Bindings for Scoreboard**  
The default key for opening the scoreboard is **'F10'** but can be changed in the `config.lua` file.

```lua
Config = {}

Config.OpenKey = 0xE30CD707  -- F10 Key
```

### **Job Display Customization**  
You can specify which jobs are displayed on the scoreboard. This can be configured in `config.lua`:

```lua
Config.JobDisplay = {
    police = true,
    ambulance = true,
    mechanic = true,
    sheriff = true,
}
```

### **Player Count Settings**  
Set up the player count display using the built-in functions:

```lua
Config.ShowTotalPlayers = true
Config.ShowJobCount = true
```

- **ShowTotalPlayers**: Enable/disable the total player count on the scoreboard.
- **ShowJobCount**: Enable/disable job-specific player counts.

---

## **Commands**

- **/scoreboard**: Manually open the scoreboard if the key binding is not used.
